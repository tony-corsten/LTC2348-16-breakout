# LTC2348-16-breakout
The Analog Devices LTC2348-16/-18 supports fully-differential, pseudo-differential and single-ended bipolar signaling at either 16 or 18-bit resolution (1LSB INL). With all eight channels active, it can sample up to 100ksps over a single SPI output (although if you have multiple SPI MISO lines, it has up to 4 simultaneous data outs). The existing Linduino library does not directly work as a port for Arduino-compatible systems (as it's intended to be used with the Linduino board, not surprisingly!), so a compatible library is also included with this breakout.
